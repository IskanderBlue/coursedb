course.db is still in the coursedb folder.  
You may wish to move it to the inst folder, but it should not be necessary.  
All of the examples that use it create their own sample database in a tempdir().  
I did not explicitly close the connections with dbDisconnect(); if I understood you correctly, R's garbage collection should do so once the functions finish running.  

createDB() gives warnings about coercing NAs, but I don't think it's a problem.  


Good luck!
