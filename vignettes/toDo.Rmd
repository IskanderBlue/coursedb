Data frame vs. matrix + vectors
Document what is needed.
      Give default plus way to override.  
      Those who will use will only use if few changes are necessary to get what they already do to 
      Make so that beginners can use, experts can customize.
            Don't make beginner enter unnecessary things.  Don't make experts do things your way.
      
Store notes as part of package.      

Plan:
      Carry out operations with real data from old term.  If all works, great; otherwise, need changes.
      Then write up description of how to do.
      Then merge with Sweavetest package. 
      Might be easier to make this a package used by Sweavetest.
            Transition to database at leisure.

Generally, make lots of commits; when you get something working, commit.
Try not to have package on GitHub not working.
      Sometimes, better to commit before working in case you would lose much work.
      Try to have build, tests before committing.
            Put a whole bunch of these in tests directory.
      
Automated testing
Version with R
      Directory in package called tests
            If Any scripts in there generate error, fail.
            Anything can go in those files.
            Eg. run through example with known answer; stop if not expected answer.
      Requires thinking what should go into tests.
Several frameworks/ packages for unit tests.
      Some love them.
      Make it easier to handle checks?
      Eg. Do this and you should generate and error/ warning, / answer should be x.
            Must not generate error if you make the right kind of error, etc.
      Eg. **testthat, testPackage (Murdoch only)
      library(testthat)
Check with Hadley on testthat use.
Roxygen has some support for testthat?
It might automatically run the tests.
      

Test-based design.
Must understand user view from the beinning.
Tests important.  Tets first?  Less certain.
      Always have examples.  Make sure they produce right answer.*******
Tests that are good for testing are not necessarily good for examples.  ***
      Throw testthat in to examples at the end.
      
Go through check output, fix what can be fixed.

Maybe add fraction of given # option to IDToQuestionsAsked/ Answered/ Combined?


No way to delete row by rownumber
Give each row an ID?

/Option to overwrite course.db in createDB()

/Be more flexible with how to update database.
/      Another argument to update students (columns or something)
/      columns default= ID = 1, ...
/      Or named columns rather than numbered
/            columns = c(..., . )
/      columns = c(ID= "ID", email = "email", ...)
/      How flexible?  Only update certain columns.
/            Try with all.

I choose names for things in database, but make it easy for people to import things into database.
      Import things with different names should work.
      Data.frames can have more columns, in differnt orders, but MUST have columns I need.  
      students: always need ID, names, email; not necessary to include program, notes.
            Make it possible to enter, but not required.
            
Flip necessaryness of assignmentNumber of date for assignments, etc.
Same with examName
More general: examName, assignmentName, not examNumber, assignmentNumber

classParticpation basically entirely optional
      Good to have, but implementation won't worry too much.



Create standard empty database.
      Import data afterwards.
      
      
Spend time on manual.
      Don't be complete.
      Start out really basically.
      Here's a typical workflow. (One possible workflow -- someone starting out, doing simple things.)
            Here's how you enter students.
                  Enter more, do this.
            Enter assignemnts , do this
            Enter ...
            Print out grades, do this.
      If I can't explain it, I should probably simplify it.

In namespace file as exported, users can see it.
      Can just export ones users use.
      start functionnames with a . if internal only.
      
      
Later, write functions for R beginners -- get stuff into data.frames

Mismatch between table and number of columns -- NA if columns not included.
If too many columns included, ...not sure.

query:
createTable() <- table name, column names, etc.
Empty data.frame
df <- data.frame(ID = character(0))
