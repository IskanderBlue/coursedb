Data frame vs. matrix + vectors
Document what is needed.
      Give default plus way to override.  
      Those who will use will only use if few changes are necessary to get what they already do to 
      Make so that beginners can use, experts can customize.
            Don't make beginner enter unnecessary things.  Don't make experts do things your way.
      
Store notes as part of package.      

Plan:
      Carry out operations with real data from old term.  If all works, great; otherwise, need changes.
      Then write up description of how to do.
      Then merge with Sweavetest package. 
      Might be easier to make this a package used by Sweavetest.
            Transition to database at leisure.

Generally, make lots of commits; when you get something working, commit.
Try not to have package on GitHub not working.
      Sometimes, better to commit before working in case you would lose much work.
      Try to have build, tests before committing.
            Put a whole bunch of these in tests directory.
      
Automated testing
Version with R
      Directory in package called tests
            If Any scripts in there generate error, fail.
            Anything can go in those files.
            Eg. run through example with known answer; stop if not expected answer.
      Requires thinking what should go into tests.
Several frameworks/ packages for unit tests.
      Some love them.
      Make it easier to handle checks?
      Eg. Do this and you should generate and error/ warning, / answer should be x.
            Must not generate error if you make the right kind of error, etc.
      Eg. **testthat, testPackage (Murdoch only)
      library(testthat)
Check with Hadley on testthat use.
Roxygen has some support for testthat?
It might automatically run the tests.
      

Test-based design.
Must understand user view from the beinning.
Tests important.  Tets first?  Less certain.
      Always have examples.  Make sure they produce right answer.*******
Tests that are good for testing are not necessarily good for examples.  ***
      Throw testthat in to examples at the end.
      
Go through check output, fix what can be fixed.

Maybe add fraction of given # option to IDToQuestionsAsked/ Answered/ Combined?
